## Introduction

This is a template microservice which will have full features from a tempalte to code pipeline.

## Features
TODO: Description of features

* Include a list of
* all the many beautiful
* web server features


## Requirements
The application can be run locally or in a docker container, the requirements for each setup are listed below.


### Docker
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)


## Quick Start
Make sure the JWT Verification Key URL is configured, then you can run the server in a docker container or on your local machine.

### Configure JWT Verification Key
Update __application.yml__. Set `auth.jwt.publicKeyUrl` to the URL to fetch the JWT verification key. The application will not start if it can't set the verification key for the JWTConverter.

The default value in the __application.yml__ file is set to connect to EGO running locally on its default port `8081`.

### Run Local
```bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

Application will run by default on port `1234`

Configure the port by changing `server.port` in __application.yml__


### Run Docker

First build the image:
```bash
$ docker-compose build
```

When ready, run it:
```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

Application will run by default on port `1234`

Configure the port by changing `services.api.ports` in __docker-compose.yml__. Port 1234 was used by default so the value is easy to identify and change in the configuration file.


## Testing
TODO: Additional instructions for testing the application.


## API
TODO: API Reference with examples, or a link to a wiki or other documentation source.
